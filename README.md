### Hey, I'm Dan

I'm a Software Engineer based in Europe and I'm currently looking for a job.

I've worked at [Zulip](https://zulip.com/), [Sber](https://sberbank.com), and [Timestripe](https://timestripe.com/onboarding/).

I graduated from both [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) and [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/).
